    title: "RISC-V Pipeline Implementation",
    year: "2021 - Present",
    description: "Design and implementation of a pipeline processor according to the RV32IM RISCâ€“V ISA. This was implemented using behavioral modeling in VerilogHDL. This processor includes a forwarding unit for hazard detection and a memory hierarchy with a data cache, an instruction cache and a main memory",

    year: "2020 - Present",
    description:
      "The main idea of this project is to develop a system of robots and a smart ordering system for a restaurant.  Current system in restaurants, the traditional menu card ordering and waiters can be replaced with the WaiterBot system. The WaiterBot system contains main 4 parts. The WaiterBots( Main hardware component for delivery of food items), mobile application(to place orders and make payments), web application(for the management of the entire system) and the desktop application(for operation of the robots and handling the orders).",

    year: "2019",
    description: "Compost quality manager is a system developed to monitor the humidity and the temperature of compost piles remotely. To get better quality compost it is required to maintain the proper conditions required for composting. Sensor nodes will capture the temperature and humidity of the compost piles in realtime and transmit the data to the receiver node. Web application displays and stores the received data.",
